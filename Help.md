cannot implement the downloaded themes in one system, try another one.<br />
<br />
2. Download and unzip the themes you want, and paste the source code to these<br />
corresponding modules. This http://bangzhuzhongxin.blogbus.com/logs/4519414.html<br />
will help you to do this.<br />
<br />
3. Right click, "Open with...", Notepad to open the html or css file in the packages.<br />
<br />
4. You can modify the Index and Log modules (in old system), or Index and Detail<br />
modules (in new system) to specify yourself's link in the navigation.<br />
<br />
5. If you are implementing a 3 columns theme in the new system, you can do the 2nd<br />
step first. And adjust the sidebar(1) and sidebar(2) to what you want.<br />
